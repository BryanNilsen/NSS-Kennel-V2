Challenge: Active NavBar Route
In the NavBar, highlight the active section. For example, if you are viewing Animals, change the <NavBar> Animals link to lime(you could also disable the ability to click). Since the<NavBaris not part of a route, you will need toexport default withRouter(NavBar)in order to have access to the router location properties. Consider how we usedloadingStatus` in a previous chapter.
